                <p>Amelia Cruella is one of the four main characters in this saga. She is also known as the "Queen of Evil."
                Unlike the other three main characters, she grow up to be more to be evil, selfish, spoiled, and cowardice.
                As a child, she used to hang out with her twin brother Emil. Unfortunately, her brother has been kidnapped by raiders.
                They were ambushed at Lux Forest. All the guards were killed, along kidnapping a maid. Amelia was mistaken as a boy and did
                not get kidnapped. The Hotaru Soldiers arrived just after the mysterious girl leaves. Running towards Amelia is a group of
                soldiers and the lead strategist, Lanka Sage.</p>
                
                <p>As a kid, Amelia is a very gullible kid. Because of that, she was easily manipulate by her father. Willing to believe him on anything. 
                    She was also poorly educated, very sheltered, and spoiled. She is often ignored by her parents. Her father and mother always give her 
                    whatever she want just to have her to go away. Only two people that show her love is her Head Maid, Aiko Harmonia and 
                    the Prince of Basileus Kingdom, Arthur Basileus.</p>
                
                <p>In "A New Ruler and the Fall", as the current Queen of Hotaru, she was not properly trained to handle politics due to poor education of her parents.
                    So she abuses the power for herself. These decision will cause her to regret the worst decision she makes.

                    <p>Merlinus Daimhin is one of the four main characters in the series. He is extremely loyal to his family and to his sister,
                        Amelia. He hides his real name "Emil" because he will die by his own people in both Adelaide and Hotaru Empire. If Adelaide knows
                        that he is the "Prince of Hotaru" (he is also Ameila's Twin Sister), they would kidnapped him and abuse that power from Hotaru to get what they want, and then kill him
                        (or so they thought). The Hotaru Empire have their own motive of killing him and that is his intelligents. Due to the fact his
                        life that he lived in a well raised area, and well educated, he is extremely difficult to manipulate.
                    </p>

                    <p>During the end of the first two sagas "The Beginning: Part 1 and 2" and the beginning of a third saga, "A New Ruler and the Fall",
                         Merlinus reunites with Amelia. Unfortunately, Amelia does not remember
                        him. Nether did his biological father, Attila remembers. Only two people in the whole Hotaru Empire remembers him.
                        Harmonia Aiko, the head maid, and Cindra Kynthos, Attila's right hand person.

                        people for slavery. He was three-years-old at that time. He killed the raiders and ran off with his sister.
                        He fought for survival for himself and his sister. One harsh bizzard day, he is struggling to move while making
                        sure his sister is warm. He faints.
                    </p>
                    <p>He woke up inside of a medical room in the Military Base. He saw his sister next to him on the same bed. He hears
                        a voice of a man in his 30s. He took him in his lift to take good care or them. He was named Althelbeorn Kaigai Ryokou.
                    </p>

                    <p>When he was six-years-old another person came to his life to be a part of his family. He introduced himself as 
                        Merlinus Daimhin. Herminuis and his sister were carefree people. They show him around the house, share toys, books and 
                        comics. All of them went to the same school in the Adelaide Empire.

                    <p>Joan Jones is "claimed" the prophecy of Hasial. She is a manipulative person who could fool her own cult following.
                        Along with her boyfriend, Jove Aaritz. Her first and only appearance is in <strong>A New Ruler and the Fall</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>At first, she has a power to "revive" someone. Her boyfriend posed as the Martyr and then brought back to life. She asked 
                        Queen Amelia if it is okay to move the cult to make a new town known as Jovetown. Amelia says it is okay. Without knowing 
                        any information of anything that is going on.
                    </p>

                    <p>Joan and Jove have the cult do all the labor. Like building houses, farming, and educated the young. While Jove and Joan
                        are the ones doing a lot of overseeing. They do got a messenger to travel back and forth. He would be Merlinus Dainhim walking
                        with Queen Amelia.
                    </p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, Merlinus told one of the Councils of Court Kendra Judas, Merlinus's Teacher, that they are going to
                        tell the people that the media would hear about this. Joan and Jove were planning to have a mass suicide.
                    </p>

                    <p>Once the media hears about, Jove and Joan have their own cult to force suicide by drinking "water". This water is tainted
                        with Red Wolfsbane Poison, causing people to die in about 30 seconds.
                    </p>

                    <p>Merlinus and the rescue team were ambushed. Only two people lived. Merlius and Kendra. Amelia was not with Merlinus at the time.
                    </p>

                    <p>Joan and Jove died of stabbing each other at the head. They couldn't do the same thing like the rest of the people.</p>

                    <p>Kristen Azazel is a serial killer in Hestia. At the age of ten, she was the main caused of a parricide. She was never apprehended.
                         She had one mother and father, one older brother, two younger sisters, and three of her 
                         sibling's friends. Her family did terrible things to her. This includes: rape, torture, 
                         and prostitution. The main reason was because the mother was jeleous of how Kristen looks pretter than
                         herself When the military police found out there was a murder, Kristen was out in 
                         the open covered in blood. The police though Kristen was traumatized of the murder. Kristen 
                         was considered not suspicious because they believe a ten year old cannot commit that kind of 
                         murder, so the mystery of the murder remained unsolved. Both the crime and the trial takes
                          place South East of the Capital of Adelaide. It’s a mid-populated city named, Salben.
