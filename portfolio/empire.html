                <p>Amelia Cruella is one of the four main characters in this saga. She is also known as the "Queen of Evil."
                Unlike the other three main characters, she grow up to be more to be evil, selfish, spoiled, and cowardice.
                As a child, she used to hang out with her twin brother Emil. Unfortunately, her brother has been kidnapped by raiders.
                They were ambushed at Lux Forest. All the guards were killed, along kidnapping a maid. Amelia was mistaken as a boy and did
                not get kidnapped. The Hotaru Soldiers arrived just after the mysterious girl leaves. Running towards Amelia is a group of
                soldiers and the lead strategist, Lanka Sage.</p>

                <p>Because of this event, she is tramitized. She is willing to risk her life just to get her brother back in any means.
                    The results always ended up in failure because of her weak stamina and constantly get pulled back by 
                     her head maid, and soldiers of Hotaru.
                </p>

                <p>As a kid, Amelia is a gullible. Because of that, she was easily manipulate by her father. Willing to believe him on anything. 
                    She was also poorly educated, very sheltered, and spoiled. She is often abandoned by her parents. Her father and mother always give her 
                    whatever she want just to have her to go away. Only two people that show her love is her Head Maid, Aiko Harmonia and 
                    the Prince of Basileus Kingdom, Arthur Basileus.</p>
                
                <p>In "A New Ruler and the Fall", as the current Queen of Hotaru, she was not properly trained to handel politics due to poor education of her parents.
                    So she abuses the power for herself. These decision will cause her to regret the worst decision she makes. These decision </p></div>

                        that he is the "Prince of Hotaru", they would kidnapped him and abuse that power from Hotaru to get what they want, and then kill him
                        (or so they thought). The Hotaru Empire have their own motive of killing him and that is his intelligents. Due to the fact his
                        life that he lived in a well raised area, and well educated, he is extremly difficult to manipulate.

                        people for slavery. He was three-years-old at that time. He killed the raiders and ran off with his sister.
                        He fought for survival for himself and his sister. One harsh bizzard day, he is struggling to move while making
                        sure his sister is warm. He faints.
                    </p>
                    <p>He woke up inside of a medical room in the Military Base. He saw his sister next to him on the same bed. He hears
                        a voice of a man in his 20s. He took him in his lift to take good care or them. He was named Althelbeorn Kaigai Ryokou.

                         and prostitution. The main reason was because the mother was jeleous of how Kristen looks pretter than
                         herself When the military police found out there was a murder, Kristen was out in 
                         the open covered in blood. The police though Kristen was traumatized of the murder. Kristen 
                         was considered not suspicious because they believe a ten year old cannot commit that kind of 
                         murder, so the mystery of the murder remained unsolved. Both the crime and the trial takes
                          place South East of the Capital of Adelaide. It’s a mid-populated city named, Salben.
