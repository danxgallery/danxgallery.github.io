                    Unlike the other three main characters, she grow up to be more to be evil, selfish, spoiled, and cowardice.
                    As a child, she used to hang out with her twin brother Emil. Unfortunately, her brother has been kidnapped by raiders.
                    They were ambushed at Lux Forest. All the guards were killed, along kidnapping a maid. Amelia was able to struggle her way
                    out. She was about to be killed but was saved by a Mysterious Girl. She quickly flees. The Hotaru Soldiers arrived just
