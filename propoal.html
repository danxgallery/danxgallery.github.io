        <p>
            My Proposal is mainly going to target people in Animation, Motion Graphics, Illustration, UI Design
            and UI Animation. The main page will have an animation to show off my skills right off the bat. This
            is similar to the site, Moondog Animation Studio. With each and different animation shows off first
            impression of their skills as a animation studio.

            The works folder will contain Animation/Mographs, Illustration, and UI Designs. In that order. 
            Inside any of my works, there will be projects I have worked on in the past. 
            When going inside, there will be all the works and possible to scroll down.

            The abouts page will have a animation of my avatar looking up in a dark seemless background while
            the area starts to rain.
